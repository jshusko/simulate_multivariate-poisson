# simulate_multivariate-poisson
Replication of "On generating multivariate Poisson data in management science applications." Code implemented in Python.

# Description
This repository contains a replication of "On generating multivariate Poisson data in management science applications." (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asmb.901). This paper demonstrates an approach to simulating from multivariate Poisson distributions with known rate vectors and known correlation matrixs. 

See simulating_multivariate-poisson_replication.pdf for the paper reproduction. 

See sim_mvpoisson.ipynb for an implementation of the adjusted NORTA-based algorithm in Python. The original paper implements this algorithm in R.
